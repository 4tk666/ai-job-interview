/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `users` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to alter the column `email` on the `users` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(255)`.
  - You are about to alter the column `name` on the `users` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(255)`.
  - You are about to alter the column `password` on the `users` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(255)`.
  - Changed the type of `id` on the `users` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
